Before now I use to imagine how possible it is to transform raw data into actionable insights that could benefit businesses, government, hospitals, organizations etc. looking at the raw dataset one will even be confuse because of how messy and bulky the data could be and this where a data analyst comes in

Data analytics is termed as the process of extracting meaningful insights from raw data such as hidden patterns, market trends and customer preferences. This is done by studying and analyzing the procured data.

As part of a prerequisite to graduate as a data analytics, I picked up a project on sales data of Accion company limited and I am excited to share this sales performance dashboard built completely in Microsoft excel üìä.

This Sales report is all about diving into the sales data to see how Accion company limited has been performing in the year 2014. As a data analyst, my goal is to break down the numbers in a way that helps the stakeholders understand what‚Äôs working well and where we might have room to improve.
I look at key sales metrics like total revenue, performance of each sales representative, customer behavior, product performance, and sales across different regions. By analyzing these areas, we can spot trends, highlight successes, and identify opportunities for making smarter, data-driven decisions to help in the growth and expansion of the company.

The main aim or purpose of this analysis is to give a clear picture of how the company has been performing against their goals, and to help the company to make decisions that can drive even better results. Whether it‚Äôs adjusting strategies or focusing on areas that need improvement, this analysis provides some useful insights that can help in the data driven decisions.
The key aim and objectives of this analysis includes:
¬∑ Assessing overall sales performance against targets and previous periods
¬∑ Identifying high-performing products and regions for the year 2014
¬∑ Understanding customer behavior and buying patterns over the year
¬∑ Actionable Suggestions to boost sales in the coming year

Problem being Addressed
The Analysis is trying to understand why certain teams or sales person are not meeting their targets and how to address the gaps in the performance
Analyze why some products are underperforming compared to others and explore opportunities to promote them or adjust pricing strategies.
Exploring why certain regions are underperforming and identifying tailored strategies to address regional needs or challenges.
Assessing and Analyzing whether current pricing strategies are competitive and fair to customers, and determining if they need adjustments to increase sales in the coming year
Identifying why sales are down in some of the month and identifying the causes, whether it‚Äôs pricing, salesperson behavior or some other challenges to boost sales in the coming year.

Key Datasets and Methodologies
The datasets used contains detailed information about sales transaction data such as sales amounts, customer name, date, salesperson, region, unit sold
Customer data to provide information about customer to identify trends in their buying pattern this includes , customer ID, customer name, Location, city, state
Product Data contains information about each product such as product category, unit price, product name, quantity, order id, date
Sales Region Data contains information such as region, sales amount by region

Methodologies
The methods used for analysis are Microsoft Excel, pivot tables, data visualization tools such as line charts, bar charts, column charts, pie charts.
To summarize the sales performance of the sales person, region, or product for the year 2014 the tools used are Pivot Tables, this is to analyze and summarize data, for the total salesperson, region, product, etc.
I use function sum (), count () to calculate the key metrics like total revenue of each sales person, region, product etc.
Charts for visualization: bar charts, column charts, pie charts to visualize trends and distributions. 
For the sales trend analysis to identify monthly sales performance to spot growth or seasonal pattern, to calculate the total sales revenue of each month I use sum function
Charts used for visualizing the sales trends is a line chart to spot trends of sales for each month for the year 2014.

Story of Data
Data source: The Data is from public dataset

Data structure
The data is organized into rows and columns, rows representing a number of different values of transaction, columns represent different variables like order id, region, ship city, city, salesperson, product name, unit price, product category

Important Features and Their Significance
The sales variables in the data includes unit price, quantity sold, revenue
The Relevance is to know if there is low sales which indicates the failure of a product and will need appropriate measures to correct that or increase in sales volume which indicate the success of a product.
The product categories variables are product name, product type, unit price
The Relevance is to understand which product categories performed well or poorly and this can guide inventory strategies.
The high performing product can be pushed with marketing while the poorly performing product needs price adjustments or rebranding.
The high performance product can also reveal trends and consumer preferences in the market.. This can help align product offerings with consumer demand and thereby increase the company revenue.
Understanding different categories of product that have a large profit margin also help businesses to focus on high margin products

Data limitations or biases 
The datasets contain duplicate, errors, inconsistent letters, missing values, the headings are not well spelt out, white spacing, and all of these can affect the result of the analysis.

Data cleaning
The data sets contain duplicates, errors ,white spacing and missing values and these can affect the insights given at the end of the analysis.
Remove duplicates: select the dataset, click on the data tab and remove the duplicate.
white spacing , I use trim, the function =(trim) , to remove the white spacing between the letters to avoid any inconsistency ,click on the formula tab-text-trim
I also ensure I put the currency sign on the income column for proper result, home tab-number ribbon-currency
For consistency letters , I ensure there is consistency in the letters before analysis, I ensure I put proper cases throughout the datasets for consistency.
Lastly, I ensure the data is kept on the standard excel table, because it allows easy automation and accuracy.

Data splitting 
The datasets was split into two categories, independent variables or value and dependent variable or value
Independent variables includes :salesperson, customer name, product category, product name , region, city, address
Dependent variables such as unit price, quantity, revenue, shipping fee, zip code.

Industry Type/context: the data is sales performance data of a Grocery store with different products shipped across different region
The company‚Äôs core value is making more profits by generating more revenue and that‚Äôs the company‚Äôs success story.

 Assessing the overall sales performance of the salesperson will help the company to know their sales representative performance, so the underperforming sales representative can be sent for training or seminar for improvement.
Also identifying or analyzing high performed products will help in the inventory or stock of the product
